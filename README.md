This website is created by Alif Ramdani a.k.a alramdein (https://github.com/alramdein). I open this repo publicly so I hope it can help others who want to learn Web Development or just use it on their projects. 

But creating a website takes time and effort, kindly respect my work by credit it to me or attribute my repo on your project.
